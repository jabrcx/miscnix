NAME
    generate_setup.sh/setup.sh - handle shell environment setup things

SYNOPSIS
    generate_setup.sh/setup.sh [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]

DESCRIPTION
    This script is used for setting up the environment, or for creating code 
    that will setup the environment, for software that's laid out in the 
    Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (GNU) way under a prefix -- i.e. directories 
    named \`bin' should be added to the PATH, directories named \`lib' added to 
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.  Copy this script as-is for a general purpose 
    setup.sh, or use it with options for printing out a setup.sh file or code 
    to be used in modules files (see http://modules.sourceforge.net/).

    DIRECTORY can be used to specify the directory in which to look.  The 
    default is the parent directory of this script's location.  See EXAMPLES 
    below for details.

    This script is aggressive in setting variables, e.g. it adds any 
    directories named \`include' to both CPATH and FPATH, even though there is 
    often only one of those two languages used.  To avoid clutter, it's 
    suggested to double check what it does.

    In addition to searching for the normal GNU layout, this script also has an 
    option -x/--executables to add to PATH all subdirectories with executables 
    in them.

    This script will not dig into .git, .svn, or CVS directories.

    Note that although setup.sh is a more appropriate name for this script, it 
    is NOT named so -- bash's source built-in searches PATH before looking in 
    PWD for files, and this could really mess up people used to doing \`source 
    setup.sh' and not \`source ./setup.sh'.  Furthermore, if you run 
    \`generate_setup.sh DIRECTORY', it only sets up the environment, it does 
    not write out DIRECTORY/setup.sh, as the name may imply.

OPTIONS
    --format FORMAT
        FORMAT values can be \`bash' or \`modules' (see 
        http://modules.sourceforge.net/).  Default is \`bash'.

    --action ACTION
        ACTION values can be \`echo', to just print the code to the screen, or 
        \`eval', to actually evaluate it.  \`eval' only works for \`--format 
        bash'.  Default is \`eval'.
    
    --max-depth LEVELS
        Maximum depth at which to look (find's -maxdepth option).  Default is 
        effectively infinite.

    -x, --executables
        Add to PATH all the subdirectories with executables in them that are 
        found within the directory in which this script lives.  Only 
        directories to --max-depth are added.  By default, this is done in 
        addition to the normal search and therefore may add directories to the 
        PATH twice; see also --no-fhs-search.

    --no-fhs-search
        Do not do the standard search for bin, lib, etc.  Use in combination 
        with -x/--executables, otherwise this script will do nothing.
    
    -m, --modules-format
        Legacy.  Shorthand for \`--format modules --action echo'.

    -h, --help
        Print this help.

EXAMPLES
    As-is, this script functions as a normal setup.sh, and it's dynamic:
        install -m 644 \`which generate_setup.sh\` PATH/TO/SOFTWARE/setup.sh
    
    To generate a cleaner but static version, use the following:
        generate_setup.sh --action echo PATH/TO/SOFTWARE > PATH/TO/SOFTWARE/setup.sh
    
    To print code for a modules file, use:
        generate_setup.sh --format modules --action echo PATH/TO/SOFTWARE

REQUIREMENTS
    If no DIRECTORY is given, this requires the BASH_SOURCE variable, something 
    that was introduced around version 3 of bash.
